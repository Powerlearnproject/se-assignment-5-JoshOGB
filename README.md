2. **Add Remote Repository**:
   - If your repository is not already linked to a remote repository (like GitHub), you need to add it:
     - Use the `Terminal` in VS Code or your command line:
       ```bash
       git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
       ```
     - Replace `<remote_repository_URL>` with your GitHub repository URL.

3. **Push Commits to GitHub**:
   - After committing your changes locally, push them to GitHub:
     - Click on the `...` (more actions) button in the Source Control view and select `Push`.
     - Alternatively, open a terminal and run:
       ```bash
       git push -u origin main
       ```
     - Replace `main` with your branch name if it's different (e.g., `master`, `main`, etc.).

4. **Authenticate and Enter Credentials**:
   - If prompted, authenticate with your GitHub credentials to push changes.

### Additional Tips:

- **Branching and Merging**: Use VS Code’s Source Control view to create and switch branches, merge changes, and resolve merge conflicts.
- **Pulling Changes**: Use `Pull` in the Source Control view or `git pull` from the terminal to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch.

By following these steps, developers can effectively utilize Git for version control directly within Visual Studio Code, ensuring efficient collaboration and management of project codebase with GitHub or other Git hosting platforms.
